# weather-app

## Description

My application can be viewed [here](https://mcktayl.github.io/weather-app/). 

I set out to create an application that addresses the following user story:

AS A traveler<br>
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities<br>
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly


In completing this application, I gained more experience with JQuery and using third party APIs.  I used multiple Open Weather APIs to pull and display useful data to the user, such as temperature, wind speed, humidity percentage, and UV index.  I also gained more experience with using Bootstrap as a way to easily add CSS styling.

## Installation

This application runs in the browser and requires no installation by the user.

## Usage

The user is presented with a search box.  Once the user enters a value and presses "Search," the current weather and 5 day forecast is displayed on the right for the city searched.  This city is saved onto a list of previous searches, each of which can be pressed to display that city's current weather and 5 day forecast.
